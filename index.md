# Unified Resonant Substrate (URS)
**Welcome** to the Official URS Portal!

The Unified Resonant Substrate (URS) is a breakthrough physics framework that reimagines reality not as particles and forces, but as harmonics, resonance, and curvature woven into a dynamic geometric field. URS predicts the emergence of mass, time, and fundamental constants from a single substrate — no postulates, no black-box forces.

At the heart of this effort is - [Project 6](docs/Project6.md) — a bold initiative to detect and correct quantum drift in real-time, offering a path to more stable, reliable quantum computing.

If we can predict the drift, we can preserve coherence.
