# Unified Resonant Substrate (URS)
Welcome to the Official URS Portal

The Unified Resonant Substrate (URS) is a breakthrough physics framework that reimagines reality not as particles and forces, but as harmonics, resonance, and curvature woven into a dynamic geometric field. URS predicts the emergence of mass, time, and fundamental constants from a single substrate â€” no postulates, no black-box forces.
