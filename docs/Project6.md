#  Project 6: Quantum Drift Detection & Stability Framework

## What Is Project 6?

**Project 6** is the flagship application of the Unified Resonant Substrate (URS) theory — a live demonstration of URS’s ability to detect *quantum phase drift* in real-world systems.
**Project 6** is a working prototype that uses validated simulations and theoretical predictions to measure resonance-induced decoherence, enabling **next-generation quantum stabilization** and **error forecasting** at the sub-field level. 
**Project 6** includes a fully integrated Decoherence Summary System — effectively transforming it into a quantum thermometer for real or simulated environments. By analyzing the predicted mass emergence of particles within a system, the tool generates a graded coherence health report, flagging areas of resonance drift before full decoherence occurs.

Each prediction is compared against validated baselines, and output is translated into intuitive drift categories ranging from Stable Resonance to Critical Drift. These categories allow researchers and engineers to quickly assess the quantum integrity of a system and take proactive measures.

This enhancement makes **Project 6** not just a detector of phase instability, but a live coherence diagnostic interface — capable of quantifying and visualizing quantum system health in real time.

The decoherence grading model operates across multiple scales, meaning it can assess coherence at the level of:

   - Large simulated particle environments (e.g., LHC files)

   - Single qubit systems (GHZ/Bell states)

   - Time-evolving systems in noise or curvature

**Project 6** offers a new way to interpret emergent mass behavior as a predictive signal of decoherence — effectively making URS a practical framework for quantum state integrity assessment in both research and commercial domains.

> Think of Project 6 as a diagnostic and predictive toolset for the quantum age — where classical calibration ends, URS begins.

##  Objectives of Project 6

-  **Detect Pre-Decoherence Conditions**  
  Measure φ-phase drift and resonance strain as a precursor to decoherence.

-  **Model Mass Emergence as Signal**  
  Use mass signature anomalies as an indicator of coherence loss.

-  **Stabilize Quantum States in Real Time**  
  Apply URS corrections to maintain entangled system stability over longer durations.

-  **Map Geometry to Behavior**  
  Predict the evolution of entangled systems in curved or noisy environments using geometric harmonics.
