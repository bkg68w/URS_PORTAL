# Unified Resonant Substrate (URS) – Public Summary

## Abstract

The **Unified Resonant Substrate (URS)** is a geometric framework that explains mass, time, and fundamental coupling constants as **emergent properties** of a quantized resonance field. Rather than postulating constants or particles, URS derives their behaviors from substrate curvature, harmonic phase interactions, and topological constraints.

The Lagrangian model (**URS_L6**) incorporates:
- Harmonic recycling (resonant reinforcement with coherence loss)
- Topological compaction (mass scaling via curvature loops)
- Angular suppression (field coherence boundary effects)

URS has produced predictive results for:
- Lepton mass scaling (e⁻, μ⁻, τ⁻)
- Phase drift under curvature (confirmed via pulsar timing models)
- Redshift and decay timing correlation
- Structural emergence of α (fine-structure constant) as a coherence constraint

## I. Motivation

The Standard Model (SM) and General Relativity (GR) leave open several foundational questions:

- Why does mass exist?
- Why do decay and redshift correlate with curvature?
- Why are constants like α small, fixed, and seemingly structureless?

URS reframes these questions, treating reality not as built from particles but as a **resonant substrate**, where particle-like behaviors emerge from persistent geometric waveforms interacting in quantized space.

## II. Core URS Principles

1. **Emergent Mass**  
   Mass arises from the recursive locking of harmonic phase loops in a curved substrate. Each "N" represents a topological class, and mass scales nonlinearly with its compacted structure.

2. **Phase Drift and Decoherence**  
   Gravitational environments induce time-drift via angular stress fields, causing phase decoherence in long-lived quantum states.

3. **Resonance-based Time**  
   Time is not a dimension but a **phase-ordering** of internal curvature harmonics. Observed time emerges from φ-node drift and field envelope interference.

4. **Coherence Constraint (α)**  
   The fine-structure constant appears not as a random value, but as a **structural limit** — a cap on angular resonance coherence across topological transitions.

## III. URS_L6 Lagrangian (Public Summary)

The full Lagrangian includes:

- A kinetic φ-term with nonlinear curvature response
- A harmonic recycling term with coherence dampening
- A potential term arising from topological boundary compaction
- An angular coupling term linking bands via emergent α constraints

**Note**: Detailed equations and parameterizations are under provisional patent protection and released only under NDA or partnership agreements.
