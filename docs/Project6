## Project 6: Quantum Drift Detection & Stability Framework

**What Is Project 6?**

**Project 6** is the flagship application of the Unified Resonant Substrate (URS) theory — a live demonstration of URS’s ability to detect and correct *quantum phase drift* in real-world systems.

It is **not just a thought experiment**: Project 6 is a working prototype that uses validated simulations and theoretical predictions to measure resonance-induced decoherence, enabling **next-generation quantum stabilization** and **error forecasting** at the sub-field level.

> Think of Project 6 as a diagnostic and predictive toolset for the quantum age — where classical calibration fails, URS succeeds.

## 🎯 Objectives of Project 6

- ✅ **Detect Pre-Decoherence Conditions**  
  Measure φ-phase drift and resonance strain as a precursor to decoherence.

- ✅ **Model Mass Emergence as Signal**  
  Use mass signature anomalies as an indicator of coherence loss.

- ✅ **Stabilize Quantum States in Real Time**  
  Apply URS corrections to maintain entangled system stability over longer durations.

- ✅ **Map Geometry to Behavior**  
  Predict the evolution of entangled systems in curved or noisy environments using geometric harmonics.
